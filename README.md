## Opening background information
```
✅ Recent developments in autonomous driving technology have attracted more attention with
artificial intelligence-based recognition systems combining LiDAR and cameras, and these technologies
are playing an important role in a range of applications such as size plate recognition for vehicles
(automatic license plate recognition, ALPR).
```
---
## General description of the current project
```
✅ This project is to develop a vehicle license plate recognition system using YOLOv5.
It recognizes the vehicle's license plate as a partner, acknowledges it, and performs various functions
such as tracking stolen vehicles and automatic parking management.
```
---
## Proposed idea for enhancements to the project
```
✅ YOLOv5 processes the entire image at once to achieve accurate object detection while maintaining
high frame rates. This allows license plate recognition in real time even in environments where
vehicles are moving quickly.
```
---
## Value and significance of this project
```
✅ This project can be used in various fields such as traffic management, law enforcement,
and parking management through vehicle license plate recognition, and is an essential element
for autonomous vehicles to comply with traffic rules in real time and identify violative vehicles.
```
---
## Current limitations
```
✅ Limitations faced include poor recognition performance in various environmental conditions.
For example, when driving in bad weather or at night, it is difficult to accurately recognize license plates
using cameras alone, and vehicles moving at high speeds or partially obscured license plates
are highly likely to cause errors in existing systems.
```
---
## Literature review
```
✅ Because there are limitations such as dependency issues on large-scale datasets and poor performance
in various environments, improvements are needed by securing more datasets and using additional sensor
fusion technologies such as LiDAR.
